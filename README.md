# H1B-Data-Analysis

### Objective

The main objective of the project is to identify and analyze key factors influencing the granting of H1-B visas, despite the lottery-based system, and develop a machine learning prediction model to estimate the probability of an individual obtaining an H1-B visa. The H1-B data was extracted from the USCIS portal from 2017 to 2022. The analysis was carried out on 3.5 million observations and 13 attributes.

###	Results
- H-1B visa is a lottery system, but our analysis showed various factors play an important role in the prediction of whether an individual getting an H-1B visa or not.
- Our analysis showed that Employer, SOC title, job title, work state, and wage category played an important role in predicting if an individual would get an H-1B certification or denial.
- Our business problem was to predict if there were external factors that could determine if an individual can get an H-1B certified or denied, we were able to predict that there were several factors that affected in certification or denial of an H-1 visa.
- Software Engineer at Cognizant based in California with High-Income wage is likely to get their H- 1B approved.
- Analyst at NTT Data based in Alabama with Low-income wage is unlikely to get their H-1B visa approved
